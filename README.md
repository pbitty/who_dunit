## who_dunit

This module allows you to store the user that created and last-updated a model.


## Usage

### In your model
```ruby
    class Model < ActiveRecord:Base
        who_dunit #Enable saving of created_by and updated_by
    end
```

### In your base controller class (usually ApplicationController)

``` ruby
	class ApplicationController < ActiveController:Base
		who_dunit #Enable tracking of current user
	end
```

### Migrations

## TODO Write migration example
``` 


## Design

In ApplicationController:
* around_filter stores the current user in current thread for the duration of the action
** current user stored in thread-local variable 

In Model:
* has_one association to user for 'created_by'
* has_one association to user for 'updated_by'
* before_create calback sets 'created_by' column
* before_save callback sets 'updated_by' column
